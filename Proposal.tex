\begin{abstract}
We will be creating a similar game in the vein of Flappy Bird, which we are calling "Leaping Llamas." If the initial challenge proves to be trivial, we intend to add combat elements to increase the difficulty. Players looking for a casual yet challenging game should enjoy Leaping Llamas.

\section{Introduction}
	The goal of this project is to create a simple yet fun game that can be played by anyone on a windows computer using only a mouse and keyboard.  For the type and content of the game we decided to go with a similar style to the popular game “Flappy Bird”.  At minimum we would like to include all of the basic functionality of the original game, so things like the auto generated level that is continuous and a high score system will definitely be incorporated into the app.
	
	Once all of the basic functionality described above is implemented we have plans to add additional functionality including variable difficulty settings and possibly even a “bullet hell” type game mode. We’re confident this will not only be an enjoyable experience for us the creators, but we also believe it will be fun for our peers to play post launch. By taking the “Flappy Bird” formula and making a more challenging experience, we think we can make a game that is relatively simple, but ultimately hard to master.
 

\subsection{Background}
	"Flappy Bird" is a game where the player controls a small bird, using inputs to lift the bird in order to navigate through pipes. Gravity pushes the bird down, but inputs can easily send the bird too high.

	If we reach our initial goals, we will convert Leaping Llamas into a bullet hell. A bullet hell is a game in which players must navigate through hordes of enemy projectiles without being hit. We believe it will make the game hilariously difficult and add an interesting twist to the Flappy Bird formula.

	We decided to tackle this project because it's a simple, universally-recognized game. It's known for being fun and addictive. We want to make a game that's cute, funny, and addicting, and a game like Flappy Bird is a fantastic inspiration to us.

\subsection{Challenges}
	We expect that insuring the player character's movement is smooth and responsive will be difficult. Hit boxes and fail states will be initially difficult. If we decide to have randomly generated pipes, we believe this will prove to be extremely tricky.

\section{Scope}
	Our main goal is to make Leaping Llamas, a simple Flappy Bird-like game. If we find ourselves finished well before the due date, we will add additional mechanics to further set it apart from Flappy Bird. Firstly, we would like to add bullet hell mechanics. Bullet hell mechanics are a usually extreme or hell-like amount of obstacles, usually bullet-like, that while challenging should be dodgable from somewhere on-screen.  Secondly, we would like to add onto the existing game in the form of animating objects, in order of: the background, the llama, any buttons, and any obstacles like 'pipes' and/or bullet-likes. 

\subsection{Requirements}
	As part of fleshing out the scope of your requirements, you'll also need to keep in mind both your functional and non-functional requirements.  These should be listed, and explained in detail as necessary.  Use this area to explain how you gathered these requirements.

\subsubsection{Functional}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The game must be controlled with "Spacebar" key or "left-click" mouse button.
	\item The game must be implemented with C\# WPF.
	\item The game must feature music and sound effects.
	\item The game must feature obstacle generation with several different difficulty options.
	\item The game must be pausable with the "P" key.
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Security -- user credentials must be encrypted on disk, users should be able to reset their passwords if forgotten
	\item Performance -- Speed of obstacle generation.
	\item Scalability -- The obstacle generation will be potentially unlimited obstacle generation.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use Cases}
	This subsection is arguably part of how you define your project scope (why it is in the Scope section...).  In a traditional Waterfall approach, as part of your requirements gathering phase (what does the product actually \emph{need} to do?), you will typically sit down with a user to develop use cases.

	You should have a table listing all use cases discussed in the document, the ID is just the order it is listed in, the name should be indicative of what should happen, the primary actor is typically most important in an application where you may have different levels of users (think admin vs normal user), complexity is a best-guess on your part as to how hard it should be.  A lower number in priority indicates that it needs to happen sooner rather than later.  A sample table, or Use Case Index can be seen in Table \ref{tab:useCaseIndex}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Use Case ID & Use Case Name & Primary Actor & Complexity & Priority \\
\hline \hline
1 & Start Window & User & Simple & 1\\

2 & Choose Difficulty & User & Simple & 1\\

3 & Playing \textit{Leaping Llamas} & User & Hard & 1\\

4 & Scoreboard after \textbf{Game Over} & System & Med & 1\\

5 & High Score Screen & System & Med & 1\\

\end{figure}



\subsection{Interface Mockups}
For all below see Figure \ref{fig:mockup}
First in order, the user will begin on the 'Title' screen and choose one of the button to move to the corresponding screen. Next the 'Difficulty' screen buttons will all lead to the 'Game' screen. The 'Game' screen will always lead to the 'Score' screen at the end of the game. The 'Score' screen has two choices as follows. Lastly, the 'Highscore' screen will lead to two different options as follows.

\section{Project Timeline}
See Figure \ref{fig:timeline} below.

\section{Project Structure}
At first, this will be a little empty (it will need to be filled in by the time you turn in your final report).  This is your chance to discuss all of your design decisions (consider this the README's big brother).

\subsection{UML Outline}
Show the full structure of your program.  Make sure to keep on updating this section as your project evolves (you often start out with one plan, but end up modifying things as you move along).  As a note, while Dia fails miserably at generating pdfs (probably my fault), I have had much success with png files.  Make sure to wrap your images in a \texttt{figure} environment, and to reference with the \texttt{ref} command.  For example, see Figure \ref{cat2}.

%\begin{figure}[ht!]
%\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{cat2.jpg}
%\caption{Your figures should be in the \emph{figure} environment, and have captions.  Should also be of diagrams pertaining to your project, not random internet kittens}
%\label{cat2}
%\end{figure}


\subsection{Design Patterns Used}
Make sure to actually use at least 2 design patterns from this class.  This is not normally part of such documentation, but largely just specific to this class -- I want to see you use the patterns!


\section{Results}
This section will start out a little vague, but it should grow as your project evolves.  With each deliverable you hand in, give me a final summary of where your project stands.  By the end, this should be a reflective section discussing how many of your original goals you managed to attain/how many desired use cases you implemented/how many extra features you added.

\subsection{Future Work}
Where are you going next with your project?
For early deliverables, what are your next steps?  (HINT: you will typically want to look back at your timeline and evaluate: did you meet your expected goals?  Are you ahead of schedule?  Did you decide to shift gears and implement a new feature?)
By the end, what do you plan on doing with this project?  Will you try to sell it?  Set it on fire?  Link to it on your resume and forget it exists?
